# duplication-reduction-refactor-softskill

## Purpose

Use this softskill to review a real codebase and recommend concrete refactoring steps that reduce duplication through careful consolidation, shared helpers, reusable core flows, light data-structure harmonization where it is actually useful, and removal of redundant layers or call chains.

This softskill is about making the codebase smaller, clearer, easier to maintain, and easier to extend by removing repeated code, repeated structural patterns, unnecessary function-to-function chains, needless shape fragmentation, repeated late-bound decision points, shared wrappers that merely relocate old responsibilities instead of deleting them, functions with large headers but very small implementations when they are mostly ceremony around a thinner shared core, tiny over-specialized functions that fragment logic without creating meaningful reuse, and incomplete refactors that introduce a new shared path without fully adopting it or deleting the old one.

Focus on:

- duplicated logic
- repeated flow shapes
- near-duplicate helpers
- repeated orchestration
- copy-paste variation points
- consolidation opportunities
- reusable shared core functions
- deleting redundant wrappers or layers
- reducing total code surface without reducing clarity
- analyzing common data structures in the app and harmonizing them when that is sensible
- reducing unnecessary function call chains, pass-through layers, and long internal forwarding paths
- deleting duplicated wrappers after repeated forwarding layers fail to add real meaning
- moving behavior selection earlier when the source shows the choice can be resolved once up front
- avoiding “generic shared code” that only absorbs old seams without shrinking them
- targeting functions with large parameter lists, long generic/type headers, or bulky signatures when the implementation body is tiny and mostly forwards, reshapes, or lightly selects
- targeting tiny highly specialized functions as inline candidates when they mainly split one local thought into another named hop without creating real reuse or boundary value
- preferring one focused, completed deduplication slice over a broad pass that leaves migrations half-finished
- treating unused new shared paths, partially migrated callers, and obsolete leftover fragments as strong reduction targets
- making minimal changes that align with the rest of the codebase instead of introducing a new style

The output should not be abstract architecture talk.
It should read like practical reduction-oriented refactoring guidance a developer can act on.

## Core Goal

Make the codebase easier to change by reducing the number of places that implement the same idea.

That usually means improving:

- maintainability
- flexibility
- expansion safety
- consistency
- local reasoning
- discoverability
- change speed
- code volume to understand per feature
- shape consistency for common application data where the source shows meaningful overlap
- navigation simplicity by shortening unnecessary call paths
- simplicity of execution seams by resolving behavior-driving choices once instead of repeatedly
- completion quality by finishing a reduction slice instead of leaving old and new paths active together

## Use This Softskill When

Use this softskill when the user wants help with:

- reducing duplication
- simplifying an overgrown codebase
- extracting shared helpers
- creating reusable core functions
- merging repeated patterns
- collapsing redundant layers
- shrinking boilerplate
- making a system easier to extend without copying more code
- finding what is written multiple times and simplifying it
- harmonizing repeated data structures across modules when that reduces friction
- removing needless function call chains or forwarding wrappers
- identifying shared code that became broader without making the touched seam smaller
- moving repeated behavior selection or repeated lookup out of inner layers when that can be done safely
- identifying wide-signature thin-body functions that should be removed, inlined, merged, or replaced by a more unified shared path
- identifying tiny over-specialized functions that should likely be inlined back into their real owner
- finishing incomplete deduplication work where a new central path exists but callers or fragments still linger on the old path

## Do Not Use This Softskill When

Do not use this softskill for:

- isolated syntax fixes
- one-off bug fixes with no structural relevance
- performance tuning only
- purely cosmetic renaming
- framework migration planning without duplication or consolidation relevance
- forcing one universal data structure onto domains that clearly need different shapes
- flattening call paths when the extra layer carries real ownership, policy, validation, or boundary meaning

## Source First

Always base the advice on the actual source material.

Useful sources include:

- code files
- repo structure
- imports and dependencies
- build files
- package manifests
- project references
- entrypoints
- scripts and workflow definitions
- repeated call paths
- tests
- docs that describe system behavior
- repeated DTOs, view models, payloads, adapters, mappers, and serialized shapes
- function stacks that repeatedly hop through thin wrappers before reaching the real implementation
- functions whose declarations are much larger than their bodies because they mostly forward, repackage, or lightly branch before calling the real implementation
- tiny named functions whose bodies are so narrow and specialized that they mainly create an extra navigation hop around code that could be understood inline
- partially migrated seams where a new shared function exists but only some callers use it and old fragments still remain beside it

Do not give generic advice unless it clearly maps back to repeated patterns seen in the source.

## What To Look For

Look for source-level signs that the same behavior or structure is implemented more than once.

Examples:

- the same normalization or validation logic repeated across modules
- multiple helpers with nearly identical behavior and different names
- existing helpers that overlap heavily in inputs, outputs, and responsibility
- repeated path, config, manifest, or environment resolution
- controllers, commands, services, scripts, or jobs repeating the same orchestration steps
- duplicated error handling, retry, logging, or result wrapping
- repeated mapping logic between the same conceptual shapes
- multiple modules branching on the same cases in the same way
- pass-through abstractions that add files and indirection without reducing duplication
- copy-paste setup blocks for tools, loaders, clients, pipelines, or package scripts
- large utility folders that exist because the same code keeps being copied around
- multiple modules representing the same conceptual entity with mostly overlapping fields but slightly different names or omissions
- repeated shape padding logic where missing fields are added ad hoc instead of through one clear normalization path
- long call chains where functions mostly rename, forward, rewrap, or lightly translate the same inputs without adding clear responsibility
- repeated wrapper-on-wrapper call stacks where several thin functions only pass through arguments before the first function that actually owns behavior
- repeated behavior selection by name, key, type, mode, command, family, registry entry, or similar discriminator across multiple layers
- inner helpers re-resolving config, handlers, definitions, policies, flavors, execution variants, or equivalent behavior-driving inputs that could have been resolved once earlier
- helper chains where each step performs a tiny transform or wraps values into another intermediate shape without adding meaningful ownership
- wide-signature thin-body functions whose parameters, type/header ceremony, or return shaping are much larger than the logic they contain
- several wide-header functions that differ mostly in wiring, forwarding, or light preparation and should instead converge on one narrower shared core
- tiny highly specialized functions, especially single-call-site functions, whose bodies add little beyond spelling out a small local step that would be clearer inline
- partially adopted shared helpers, half-migrated flows, or duplicate fragments left behind after a central function was introduced
- obsolete old-path fragments that still prevent the new shared path from becoming the only real implementation
- too many valid findings at once, where the better move is to finish one cohesive duplication cluster instead of scattering effort across many seams
- refactors-in-progress where shared code has absorbed old responsibilities but the old wrapper seam still remains beside it

## What Good Looks Like

Prefer a structure where:

- shared code is truly shared and has a clear purpose
- feature-specific logic stays with the owning feature
- repeated flows are collapsed into one obvious implementation path where that is safe
- helper modules stay narrow and responsibility-based
- the same rule or transformation is implemented once
- adding a new case usually extends an existing shared path instead of copying a nearby file
- the total code surface shrinks without hiding behavior behind vague abstractions
- common data shapes are harmonized only where the source shows they are the same concept for the same reason
- optional or absent values are represented consistently when a shared structure exists, including using `null` where the surrounding system already treats that as the normal explicit empty value
- call paths are short enough that the real behavior is easy to find without jumping through many thin layers
- changes remain minimal and align with the surrounding code style and architecture
- behavior selection happens once near the boundary that already knows the operation context
- inner shared code receives prepared inputs rather than re-deriving execution choices
- shared code becomes flatter, with fewer transform hops and fewer intermediate objects
- wide signatures are justified by real ownership rather than by thin forwarding or repeated shape-padding
- tiny over-specialized functions are inlined when they do not provide real reuse, boundary meaning, or clearer ownership
- when many findings exist, one cohesive seam or duplication cluster is completed first instead of leaving several areas half-refactored
- a new shared helper counts as success only after the touched callers are actually rerouted through it and the old fragments in that slice are removed
- consolidation deletes the old path instead of preserving both the old seam and the new shared helper

## Consolidation Preference Order

When multiple reduction options are possible, generally prefer this order:

1. delete a useless wrapper or redundant layer
2. inline a tiny over-specialized function that adds no meaningful reuse or boundary
3. finish an incomplete migration around an already introduced shared path
4. merge overlapping existing helpers
5. extend one existing helper in a narrow, coherent way
6. harmonize repeated data shapes where the conceptual model is clearly shared
7. extract a new shared helper or core path
8. keep the code local for now if sharing would make ownership less clear

This is a preference order, not a rigid rule.
Use judgment based on clarity, ownership, and change safety.

## Extraction Decision Rule

This is mandatory.

Only recommend extracting a shared helper, shared shape normalizer, or core function when:

- the same behavior appears in two or more places
- the duplicated code has the same purpose and the same reason to change
- the shared abstraction would be easier to understand than the duplicates
- the resulting interface can stay narrow and explicit

Also take into account whether an existing helper could be extended or safely merged when helpers overlap heavily in purpose and behavior.

Only recommend harmonizing data structures when:

- two or more places represent the same conceptual entity or payload
- the fields substantially overlap
- the differences are incidental, historical, or adapter-level rather than domain-level
- one shared shape or normalization step would reduce repeated mapping or conditionals
- missing fields can be filled consistently and safely, including `null` where that is the clearest explicit empty value in the current codebase

Keep code local when duplication is small, still evolving, or specific to one feature boundary and sharing would blur ownership more than it would help.

Do not recommend extraction or harmonization when:

- the similarity is only superficial
- callers need meaningfully different behavior
- the abstraction would become a dumping ground
- local ownership would become less clear
- the shared version would need many flags, modes, or special cases
- the only way to unify shapes would be to create a fake one-size-fits-all model

Do not recommend shortening a call chain or inlining a small specialized function when:

- each layer owns a real responsibility boundary
- the intermediate function enforces policy, validation, tracing, security, or transaction behavior
- the tiny function is the clearest ownership point for a rule likely to evolve independently
- removing the layer would make ownership or boundaries less clear

## Minimal-Change Rule

This is mandatory.

Prefer the smallest coherent refactor that removes meaningful duplication or indirection.

That means:

- align with the current code style and module layout
- reuse existing helpers before inventing new categories
- prefer local merges, inlining, and deletions over broad reorganizations
- prefer one completed reduction slice over several partial migrations
- avoid introducing a new abstraction family when a wrapper can simply be deleted
- avoid large type-system redesigns when a small shared normalizer or shape alias is enough
- keep the resulting code easy for current maintainers to recognize

## Collapse-over-relocation rule

This is mandatory.

Prefer refactors that remove a decision point entirely over refactors that merely move that decision into a new shared helper.

When reviewing a seam, check whether the code is:

- selecting behavior repeatedly in inner layers
- performing the same lookup or resolution more than once
- wrapping already-known values into intermediate objects only to pass them onward
- preserving an old boundary as a forwarding abstraction after consolidation
- carrying a large signature through a thin layer whose body adds little beyond forwarding, tiny branching, or light reshaping
- splitting a tiny specialized step into its own function even though it adds no meaningful reuse, policy, or ownership boundary
- introducing a new central function without fully rerouting the touched callers or deleting the old fragments that still shadow it

Prefer a structure where:

- behavior-driving choices are resolved once at the outer boundary of the operation
- one prepared input, spec, context, or normalized argument set is passed downward when that fits the current codebase
- inner shared functions work from already-resolved inputs
- inner shared functions do not repeat registry lookup, definition lookup, config lookup, type-based dispatch, string-key selection, or equivalent late-bound selection
- narrow shared cores replace wide-header thin-body layers when the surrounding functions mostly differ in argument plumbing or small preparation steps
- tiny over-specialized functions are inlined back into the real owner when that removes an unnecessary hop without losing clarity
- one narrow seam or duplication cluster is finished end-to-end before moving to the next hotspot
- old forwarding seams are deleted after the real shared path exists

Do not recommend a refactor that reduces copy-paste locally but increases the number of helper layers, intermediate transform objects, repeated decision points across the seam, wide signatures that mostly exist to feed thin wrappers, needless micro-functions that fragment one local operation, or partially migrated shared paths that still cannot act as the one obvious implementation.

Success is not “more generic code.”
Success is:

- fewer total functions in the touched seam
- fewer call hops in the touched seam
- fewer intermediate custom shapes where plain inputs would do
- fewer repeated lookups of the same behavior-driving data
- fewer wide-signature thin-body functions that exist mainly to route work elsewhere
- fewer tiny over-specialized functions that exist mainly to name one local step
- fewer old fragments left beside a newly introduced shared path
- net code surface reduction after obsolete paths are removed

## Scoped-completion rule

This is mandatory.

When the source contains many valid findings, do not try to solve everything in one pass.

Prefer selecting one coherent duplication cluster, seam, caller family, or helper group that can be reduced in a completed way.

A good reduction slice usually means:

- the touched callers can actually be rerouted
- the new or improved shared function can actually become used in that slice
- obsolete old-path fragments in that slice can actually be deleted
- the result leaves one smaller, cleaner seam rather than several half-migrated seams

Treat incomplete deduplication as its own smell.

Strong signs include:

- a new central helper exists but only one caller uses it while similar callers still use the old path
- old wrappers or fragments remain beside the new shared path
- a shared normalizer or core exists but call sites still perform duplicate preparation outside it
- the codebase contains “in progress” dedup where the migration stopped before the old path could be removed

If you recommend a bounded reduction slice, make sure it is still a meaningful finished change, not just setup for a future cleanup.

## Required Output Style

The output must be concrete and task-oriented.

It should answer:

- where the codebase is repeating itself
- which duplicates should become shared helpers, shared normalizers, or core functions
- which similar-looking code should stay local
- what should be merged, extracted, harmonized, collapsed, shortened, inlined, or deleted first
- where function call chains should be reduced
- where data structures should stay different because there is no real one-size-fits-all model
- where behavior selection should move upward instead of being re-done in inner helpers
- which old wrappers, forwarding seams, repeated lookups, intermediate shapes, wide-header thin-body functions, or tiny over-specialized functions should disappear after consolidation
- which bounded reduction slice should be finished first when there are too many findings to tackle at once

## Required Output Shape

### 1. Highest-value duplication clusters

List the main repeated logic, repeated structure patterns, repeated data-shape variants, or repeated call-chain patterns seen in the source.

For each cluster, say whether it is:

- exact duplication
- near-duplicate logic
- repeated orchestration
- redundant abstraction
- duplicated shape normalization
- fragmented representation of the same conceptual data
- unnecessary function chain
- repeated late-bound selection
- responsibility relocation disguised as sharing
- wide-header thin-body indirection
- tiny over-specialized indirection
- incomplete migration or unfinished shared-path adoption

### 2. Reduction directions

Provide 2 or 3 realistic refactoring directions.

Each direction should say:

- what duplication or indirection it reduces
- what shared unit would be introduced, merged, harmonized, shortened, rerouted, inlined, or deleted
- why it fits the current source
- what tradeoff it has

If the source has many findings, at least one direction should be a bounded completed slice rather than a broad multi-area cleanup.

### 3. First concrete steps for each direction

For every direction, give at least 3 concrete refactoring tasks.

Phrase them like TODOs or issue titles.

Examples:

- `Extract the repeated path discovery loop into one shared helper with explicit filter inputs.`
- `Merge duplicate config-loading branches into one shared loader and remove the pass-through wrapper.`
- `Delete the wrapper service that only renames calls to the real implementation.`
- `Move repeated normalization code into one shared module owned by the same responsibility.`
- `Collapse the duplicated command execution flow into one small orchestration function and keep feature-specific steps injected explicitly.`
- `Harmonize repeated entity payload shapes behind one narrow normalizer and fill absent optional fields with null where that is already the project convention.`
- `Inline the thin forwarding function and remove the extra call hop from the request flow.`
- `Resolve the operation variant once at the boundary and pass the prepared inputs into the shared execution path.`
- `Delete the intermediate helper that only re-selects the same handler or definition already known by the caller.`
- `Replace the wide-signature thin-body wrapper with one narrower shared core and move the tiny preparation logic to the real ownership point.`
- `Inline the tiny specialized helper back into its only real owner and delete the extra named hop.`
- `Finish the partial migration to the shared helper for one caller group and delete the obsolete old-path fragments in the same change.`

### 4. Recommended direction

Pick one direction.

Choose the one with the best maintainability gain for the least abstraction risk.

Prefer the direction that removes duplicate logic or useless call depth with minimal structural churn.

Prefer the direction that deletes repeated decision points or forwarding seams instead of relocating them into new shared helpers.

Prefer the direction that removes wide-signature thin-body layers when they are mostly plumbing around a more coherent shared path.

Prefer the direction that inlines tiny over-specialized functions when they do not carry a real boundary or reusable rule.

When many hotspots exist, prefer the direction that finishes one meaningful reduction slice completely rather than scattering partial changes across several areas.

### 5. Ordered reduction task list

This is the most important part.

Provide at least 5 ordered tasks.

Each task should say:

- what to extract, merge, harmonize, delete, shorten, collapse, inline, reroute, or centralize
- why it should happen now
- what duplicate or indirect surface area it removes
- what clarity or maintainability benefit it creates
- what old duplicate path, wrapper, repeated lookup step, intermediate transform helper, fragmented shape, wide-header thin-body function, tiny over-specialized function, or obsolete fragment should be removed afterward when relevant

When there are many findings, make the ordered task list focus on one completed reduction slice unless the source clearly supports more.

### 6. Watchouts

Mention only relevant risks, such as:

- extracting too early
- building a giant helpers module
- merging code that looks similar but changes for different reasons
- keeping a useless abstraction after introducing a shared core path
- introducing flags instead of making the shared unit truly coherent
- moving feature-owned code into shared space without a clear long-term owner
- extracting a shared path but leaving the old duplicate code in place beside it
- reducing line count while making behavior harder to follow
- forcing unrelated data into one common structure
- filling missing values with `null` where the codebase actually distinguishes absence from explicit empty state
- shortening a call chain that was actually carrying a useful boundary
- mechanically flattening every call chain instead of only removing the repeated wrappers that add no real behavior
- moving late-bound selection into a new generic helper instead of resolving it once and deleting the old seam
- introducing prepared objects that are broader than the operation actually needs
- collapsing a wide-header function whose large signature actually reflects a meaningful boundary rather than thin plumbing
- inlining a tiny specialized function that actually exists to preserve an important ownership point or policy boundary
- touching too many duplication clusters at once and ending with several incomplete migrations instead of one finished reduction slice

## Minimum Concreteness Rule

This is mandatory.

- Every direction must include at least 3 concrete refactoring actions.
- The recommended direction must include at least 5 ordered tasks.
- Tasks must be specific enough to copy into issues, TODOs, or a refactoring checklist.
- Use concrete verbs like:
  - extract
  - merge
  - collapse
  - delete
  - replace
  - isolate
  - centralize
  - deduplicate
  - inline
  - simplify
  - harmonize
  - normalize
  - reroute
  - shorten
  - resolve
  - prepare
  - finish
- Avoid vague advice like:
  - improve maintainability
  - clean up duplication
  - create shared helpers
  - simplify architecture
  unless followed by a concrete source-level action.

## Reduction-Oriented Refactoring Heuristics

Prefer refactors that improve:

### Repeated logic reduction

- merge identical or near-identical helper functions
- centralize repeated transformations, parsing, normalization, or validation
- replace repeated switch or branching logic with one clear ownership point when that logic truly matches
- resolve behavior-driving choices once when the same lookup or selection is repeated in multiple inner layers

### Repeated orchestration reduction

- collapse command, controller, service, or script flows that repeat the same sequence with small variations
- extract stable shared flow steps and keep the varying behavior explicit
- prefer one small shared execution path over many near-duplicate handlers
- prefer one prepared operation input over multiple inner helpers that each rediscover the same execution variant

### Shared helper quality

- create helpers only when they have a narrow responsibility
- prefer responsibility-based names over vague names like `utils`, `common`, or `manager`
- keep inputs and outputs explicit so the helper remains understandable
- take overlapping existing helpers into account before introducing a new one
- where it stays coherent and safe, merging similar helpers can be better than adding another sibling helper
- do not introduce a helper that only selects behavior by name, id, type string, command string, family string, registry key, or equivalent discriminator if the caller already has enough context to resolve that choice earlier
- prefer a narrower shared core over repeated wide-signature wrappers when most of the apparent complexity lives in the header rather than in the body
- prefer finishing adoption of an already good shared helper in one caller group over introducing another parallel shared path elsewhere

### Shared core quality

- introduce a small shared core when multiple consumers need the same behavior
- centralize the stable part of the behavior and keep unstable feature-specific rules outside
- prefer one obvious source of truth over synchronized duplicate implementations
- keep the shared unit owned by a clear responsibility, not by a vague cross-cutting bucket
- prefer a flatter shared core that works on prepared inputs over a broader shared core that keeps re-querying definitions or selectors
- once a shared core exists in the touched seam, prefer completing its adoption and deleting the old fragments before expanding into another seam

### Data-structure harmonization quality

- harmonize only proven common structures, not everything that looks similar
- prefer one shared source shape or one small normalization step over many ad hoc field-mapping blocks
- keep domain-specific variants local when they genuinely differ in meaning
- when a common shape is adopted, make optional empties explicit in one consistent way, including `null` only where the surrounding codebase already uses it coherently
- remove duplicate mapping code after the harmonized structure is introduced instead of leaving both shape paths active

### Layer reduction

- delete pass-through wrappers that add indirection without behavior
- delete duplicated wrappers when several layers keep forwarding to the same real implementation
- merge tiny layers when they split one responsibility across several files for no benefit
- inline abstractions that make navigation harder but do not reduce duplication
- shorten function chains when intermediate calls only forward, rename, or rewrap values
- when several layers repeatedly re-select the same behavior, move that selection upward and pass the resolved inputs downward
- prefer rerouting callers to the first layer that performs real work instead of keeping thin pre-work wrappers alive
- do not replace three thin wrappers with one shared wrapper if the real simplification is to remove the wrapper seam entirely
- treat a large signature with a tiny body as a possible layer smell when the function mainly forwards, adapts, or lightly prepares values for another function
- treat a tiny highly specialized function as a possible inline smell when it mainly names one local step without adding reuse, policy, or ownership value
- treat partially migrated old/new path pairs as a strong reduction target, especially when the old fragment still prevents the new core from being the one obvious implementation
- do not force-collapse layers that still carry meaningful ownership, policy, or boundary behavior
- after consolidating, remove obsolete wrappers, aliases, dead call paths, and old-path fragments instead of keeping both versions around

### Safe reduction

- prefer deleting, inlining, merging, or finishing an existing migration before inventing a new framework
- prefer the smallest shared unit that removes meaningful duplication
- keep feature ownership visible after deduplication
- prefer proven reuse over speculative reuse
- prefer a local, minimal change that fits the existing code over a broad theoretical cleanup
- work on one narrow seam at a time when a larger cleanup would blur ownership or mix unrelated concerns
- if there are many findings, prioritize a slice that can be completed end-to-end

## Strong Rules

### Be source-based

Recommendations must visibly map to the code or structure reviewed.

### Prefer reduction over expansion

If duplication can be removed by merging, inlining, deleting, or finishing an incomplete migration, prefer that before suggesting a new layer.

### Extract only proven common behavior

Do not create shared helpers for hypothetical future reuse.

### Prefer maintainability over cleverness

One clear shared function is better than a configurable abstraction maze.

### Keep ownership clear

Do not reduce duplication by hiding feature behavior inside a generic dumping ground.

### Finish the reduction

When recommending a consolidation, also identify what should be deleted, replaced, rerouted, inlined, or normalized so the old duplicate implementation or forwarding seam does not linger beside the new shared path.

### Do not force uniformity

Do not force one common data structure or one shared path onto different concepts just because they look related.

### Reduce call depth when it is cheap and real

Prefer shorter, clearer call paths when intermediate layers do not justify their existence.

### Prefer the first real owner

When a call chain looks like function -> function -> function -> real function, prefer rerouting callers closer to the first function that actually owns behavior, then delete the duplicated forwarding wrappers if they add no meaningful boundary.

### Prefer early resolution over repeated inner lookup

When the same behavior-driving decision can be resolved once at the outer boundary of an operation, prefer doing that and passing prepared inputs downward rather than re-selecting behavior in inner helpers.

### Prefer completed slices over scattered progress

When many valid findings exist, prefer one finished reduction slice that fully adopts the shared path and removes the old fragments over several partial cleanups that leave multiple seams half-migrated.

### Measure success by seam collapse

Treat a refactor as successful only when the touched seam becomes smaller or flatter after obsolete wrappers, duplicate transforms, repeated lookups, old forwarding paths, wide-header thin-body layers, tiny over-specialized hops, or incomplete old-path fragments are removed.

## Good Task Examples

- `Merge the duplicated workspace-discovery routines into one shared function and keep only the variant-specific filter logic at call sites.`
- `Extract the repeated manifest-loading and validation sequence into one shared module with explicit error reporting inputs.`
- `Delete the intermediate wrapper that only forwards to the real helper with renamed parameters.`
- `Replace three near-identical formatting helpers with one responsibility-based formatter and move feature-only cases back to their owners.`
- `Collapse duplicated command setup code into one shared execution helper and inject the operation-specific action as a parameter.`
- `Centralize repeated path resolution into one small shared core function and remove the copied path-building blocks.`
- `Merge the duplicated mapping tables into one source of truth and update call sites to use it directly.`
- `Merge helper functions like ResolveWorkspaceRoot, FindWorkspaceRoot, and GetWorkspaceRoot into one helper if they resolve the same concept with only minor call-shape differences.`
- `Harmonize repeated API response shapes behind one normalizer and set absent optional fields to null only where that matches the existing contract.`
- `Inline the three-step forwarding chain between controller, facade, and thin service wrapper where only one layer contains real behavior.`
- `Resolve the handler or execution variant at the boundary and pass the prepared spec into the shared inner flow.`
- `Delete the helper that only re-reads config already resolved by the caller and route the plain value directly into the core function.`
- `Collapse the wide-signature thin-body adapter into the narrower shared core and remove the duplicate argument-plumbing layer afterward.`
- `Inline the tiny specialized helper into its only real owner and remove the extra function hop after confirming it carries no distinct policy or boundary meaning.`
- `Finish the migration of one caller family to the new shared helper and delete the obsolete old-path fragments in the same pass so the central path becomes the only real implementation for that slice.`

## Bad Advice Examples

Do not produce advice like:

- `Create more abstractions.`
- `Use shared helpers.`
- `Clean up the duplicate code.`
- `Make the architecture more reusable.`
- `Introduce a generic framework for this area.`
- `Standardize all data structures.`
- `Add a common base model for everything.`
- `Split this into more layers.`
- `Create a generic selector helper for all operation types.`
- `Introduce a reusable wrapper that centralizes dispatch by key.`
- `Start a shared migration here and clean up the old callers later.`

Those are incomplete until translated into concrete source changes.

## Preferred Tone

Be practical, direct, and reduction-minded.

The response should feel like:

- here is what is repeated
- here is what should be shared and what should stay local
- here is where common data structures make sense and where they do not
- here is which call chains should be shortened or deleted
- here is where repeated late-bound selection should move upward
- here is the simplest useful consolidation direction
- here is the bounded slice to finish first when there are many findings
- here are the first refactoring tickets to create
- here is what should disappear afterward so the seam is truly smaller

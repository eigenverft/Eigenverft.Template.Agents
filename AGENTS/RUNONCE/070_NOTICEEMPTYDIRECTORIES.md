# Notice empty directories

During the run-once phase, inspect only the current repository worktree once for empty directory trees.

A directory tree is empty when it contains no files anywhere below it. Report only the highest empty directory in each tree so nested empty directories are not listed repeatedly.

Recommend an empty directory tree only when an ordinary file inside it would be eligible for version control under the repository's effective ignore rules. Ignored, generated, build, test, cache, runtime, dependency, vendored, or otherwise repository-classified local paths are not recommendations.

After all run-once instructions are complete, append the following block to the next user-facing response only when at least one qualifying empty directory tree is recommended. Number the entries for readability. This is a recommendation only; do not remove anything unless the user asks.

```markdown
##RemoveEmptyDirs

Git does not track empty directories. This check recommends removing the following empty directory trees.

Recommended removals

1. `path/to/directory`
```

## Suggested follow-up actions

When this instruction reports at least one finding, contribute one or more suitable suggested follow-up actions to the response. Use the following as the standard example, adapting, replacing, or extending its actions when the actual findings justify a different or additional follow-up:

```markdown
<letter>) Source: `070_NOTICEEMPTYDIRECTORIES.md`

1. Remove all recommended empty directory trees.
```
